titleSample text
I wrote a sample text with the new format,
using the PyQt5 editor.
The overall experience of using a rich-text editor for rich-text editing
is quite enjoyable.
I think I like this.

The editor isn't even working well at the time of writing this.
The cursor is appearing and disappearing on the screen
and everything does not just seem but are incomplete.
It's not an usable text editor yet, but it is a text editor that can be used.
I've created a monster!

Though, what next?
I'm not sure because there's still quite lot of things that should work
for this to pass as a proper text editor for anything.
