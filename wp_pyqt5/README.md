Before you can try this thing,
do the following in this directory:

    git clone https://github.com/cheery/tree-sitter-wordprocessing

That provides the grammar for the tree-sitter
and allows it to read the wordprocessing files.

Also note it's only working in Python3,
and needs Python Qt5 bindings to work as well.

And it really isn't a great editor as-it.
Among many things it lacks undo,
and the implementation of wordprocessing files themselves
is probably not the ideal one (yet).
